This project was made by applying and expanding my knowlegde of HTML and CSS to recreate the Google homepage.

I learned how to make a header and footer that repositions correctly when the window size changes by wrapping the main content in a div.
The header and footer housed the unordered list of links using the inline value for the display property to make it horizontal.
I positioned the links to the corners of the page using left or right values for the float property in a class.
The main search bar was made using the form element with a nested input element and 2 button elements.
The main difficulty I encountered was figuring out how to apply CSS to center the image, search bar, and 2 buttons.
I eventually nailed the margin values needed to center the image.
I used the center element to align the buttons underneath the image.
After that, all that was left to do was to style the buttons and text to my liking.
